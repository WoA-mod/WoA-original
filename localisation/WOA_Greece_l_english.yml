#### Events #### 
gre.1.t:0 "Greece in 1936"
gre.1.d:0 "During the Guerra Mondiale Greece was hugely split between King Constantine's support for Germany and the Prime minister Eleftherios Venizelos support for the Entente. Eventually however Eleftherios was able to justify greek intervention in the war on the side of the Entente. This however would not go unpunished and a National Schism would occur in the nation. With support of the Entente however Eleftherios was able to take back control. But as the war turned hugely against the entente Eleftherios and his regime became heavily unpopular and many sought to potentially side with Constantine I. But during the war no attempt to overthrow  Eleftherios was made. The Treaty of Plovdiv saw greece losing much of the nation,  with the Aegean islands going to the Ottomans, Greek Macedonia and Thessaloniki going to Bulgaria and Crete became a German autonomous region. Due to this the Eleftherios government grew even more unpopular. After several suggestions over the fate of the Eleftherios administration and what to do with the nation it was decided that Constantine I was restored to the throne and that the majority of greek industries were to be under german administration. Elections were also suspended and that a newly formed party, the People’s party would control the nation under King Constantine I. However the Venizelists in the nation were outraged and angered about the nation becoming a practical puppet to the central powers, and that their precious democracy had been destroyed. This lead  to the assassination of Constantine I in 1920. His death spiralled Greece out of control, the Venizelist using the crisis sparked a revolt against the monarchist regime, leading to the Greek civil war. During the time of constantine’s death, he had still not chosen a new heir to replace him, and so the government with limited options choose former king Aléxandros I to become king again. Leader of the People’s Party, Dimitrios Gounaris, seeing the Greek political situation worsening with many more siding with the Venelists, resigned his position, and choose Georgios Kondylis, leader of the new National democratic party to succeed him. The Greek civil war saw the northern Venizelist with socialist support, forming the second Hellenic republic, and in the South the Kingdom of Greece backed by Bulgaria and Germany. Georgios Kondylis, the leader of the newly elected National Democratic party, rallied the other national parties, in hopes of securing power and unity in the government. Their coalition of parties was called the Yenikí Laïkí Rizospastikí Énosis, or General People's Radical Union (YLRE). Initially, the  Venelists, with strong support from the people had been able to push the monarchists back, however as more german support arrived, the Hellenic republic eventually collapsed, ending the civil war. (Note that the Danubian Socialist republic was unable to support them, nor was serbia due to instabillity and Danubia fighting several wars). Georgios Kondylis, having initially been unpopular for his minor role in the Great war, had managed to rally the military forces and monarchist people, gaining him much support, and allowing for his coalition of national parties to thrive, strengthening the newly formed dictatorship and forcing republican and socialist parties underground. In the following years of the war socialist elements have risen significantly in the nation. While the industries of Greece have been returned, lowering foreign influence, many still see King Aléxandros I to be a puppet king to the dictatorship, and someone who will not protect the people in their time of need. In 1936 the dictatorship government grows more and more unpopular due to their failures to properly handle the Berlin market crash, and the opposition groups are rallying their efforts for a coup to end the Kingdom, all it takes is the right moment to arrive."
