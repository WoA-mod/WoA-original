UBD_the_two_state_solution:0 "The 2-State Solution"
UBD_the_two_state_solution_desc:0 "After years of failed governments, the military came to the Kaiserreich with a plan: to reestablish the Ober Ost and ensure stability by military might, and create a new Baltic Duchy which would work towards a “civilian” solution to the problem. A radical idea, it seems to have been working out well so far."

UBD_stability_at_last:0 "Stability at Last?"
UBD_stability_at_last_desc:0 "This region is known for its nationalistic sentiments and huge instability- but it seems that the German 2-state solution is working, with Ober Ost keeping a watch over us. Things can’t be that bad, right?"

LIT_army_with_a_state:0 "Army with a State"
LIT_army_with_a_state_desc:0 "Ober Ost is the definition of the old Prussian saying, as all levels of its government is controlled by high-ranking military officers and military training is expected of every citizen. This is a must as the nation must also keep a close watch over it’s neighbour, the Second United Baltic Duchy."
