### Name and Description ###
BM_HISTORY_TITLE:0 "Brief History"

WHISPERS_OF_ANTIQUITY_NAME:0 "Legacy of the Guerra Mondiale"

WHISPERS_OF_ANTIQUITY_DESC:0 ""

###OTHER COUNTRIES DESC###
OTHER_WHISPERS_OF_ANTIQUITY_DESC:0 "It is 1936, and the world is on a brink of a new, inevitable, war. But the world is made up of more than a few monolithic empires. The smallest stones can bring about tidal waves, and these lesser states can bring about much change. Will you side with the valkists? Will you carry on the torch of the revolution? Or maybe you will grant your people true freedom, the likes of which they have never seen? The world will soon derail from its peaceful existance, plummeting into the hells of war. And it will not wait for your decisions."

###LEADER DESCRIPTIONS###
POLITICS_GEORGE_V_DESC:0 "George V of Windsor is the King-Emperor of the British Empire, more than just in name. Reigning nearly 3 times longer than his father, Edward VII, he has risen to become one of the most beloved Monarchs in British history. Under his reign the British Empire has once again asserted itself as the Global Hegemon and has economically eclipsed both their rivals and former allies following the Empire's return to Splendid Isolation. However, his invincible image does not entirely live up to reality. As the years march forward, King George's health has been steadily deteriorating, forcing him allow his son, Prince Edward, to assume a portion of his duties. Some of the Empire's finest medical experts expect him to live another 10 years at minimum, although King George privately holds an opinion to the contrary, despite his often stoic nature."

POLITICS_JFC_FULLER_DESC:0 "J.F.C. Fuller is the military dictator and leader of the former United Kingdom. With the death of the duumvirate of Haig and Kitchener, Fuller was the military's successful candidate to succeed to the position of dictator. However, he has brought with him his fascination for the occult and belief in Anglo-Saxon revival, which has caused some to regret their choice. Fuller is an erratic and cruel dictator, crushing dissent and seeking to aggressively expand his state in order to solidify control and restore England to her former glory."

POLITICS_TOM_MANN_DESC:0 "A veteran trade unionist, Tom Mann has had a long career in socialist agitation and longs to see international revolution. First, however, he must start at home."

POLITICS_OSWALD_MOSLEY_DESC:0 "Oswald Mosley saw the defeat of the British Empire in the Guerra Mondiale from the front lines. He then watched in horror as Britain collapsed in on herself and the military seized power, destroying centuries of parliamentary traditions and usurping rightful authority. He spurned Folkloric Ednewing and the Anglo-Saxon revival as nonsensical backward thinking, arguing instead from the underground political scene that Britain needed a "new machine" to fulfil her political goals. Now, Mosley is able to restore Britain's glory himself, though whether or not he permits royal power to return remains in question."

POLITICS_EDWARD_VIII_DESC:0 "With the death of George V at the end of 1935, Edward VIII became the de jure King-Emperor of the United Kingdom and her Empire overseas. However, it took for the removal of the lickspittle maniac J.F.C. Fuller for Edward to assume his full power within the United Kingdom itself. Now the King must turn to the errant parts of his Dominions and reassert British rule. Edward VIII himself is not an absolute dictator, but politics have not reverted to a pre-military coup state.."

POLITICS_ADAM_DRESSLER_DESC:0 "An orphan, a Veteran, an Austro-German, Dressler led a very difficult life. Following the Great War, Dressler would find his way to the DNVP and then become one of their most notable and charismatic speakers. Dressler would attempt to assist a DNVP-led coup in 1923, only to be crushed and forcibly detained. During his time in prison, Dressler wrote a fanatic novel titled 'Mein Deutschland das Siegreiche', a novel detailing revenge against the Western Powers and destruction of the Soviets in the East. The novel would become incredibly popular. Following a case that proved Dressler's imprisonment unlawful; he was released from prison and was greeted by hundreds of supporters. Dressler would then build up support for his newly founded Valkistische Volkspartei Deutschlands and then run for office in 1932. Dressler narrowly lost to Otto Wels, declared the results fraudulent, and then lead a coup to bring down the Wels' Government. Dressler declared himself leader of Germany in the Reichstag, something the Entente responded to with hostility due to their belief of the 1932 election being legitimate. Dressler declared a snap-election which led to an overwhelming VVD victory. With it, the Entente reluctantly accepted the belief that the 1932 elections were fraudulent. Since then, Dressler has rearmed Germany from the shadows, prepared to enforce Germany's vision for Europe through Military Might in coming years."

POLITICS_PAUL_REYNAUD_DESC:0 "Paul Reynaud made his first major appearance in French politics in 1919, Reynaud was elected as part of the Conservative 'Blue Horizon' Bloc. Quickly developing a reputation for being a Savvy politician, Reynaud soon clarified his allegiance as a member of the Fédération Républicaine. Quickly climbing ranks within the party due to his Militant nature in foreign policy, Reynaud rose to the position of the Vice-President of the FR. In 1925, Auguste Isaac resigned his position as President of the Fédération Républicaine and sought to appoint a Militant successor in order to strengthen the platform of the party. Reynaud was a natural candidate due to his popularity within the party and firm stance on foreign affiars. Under Reynaud's leadership, the Fédération Républicaine managed gathering the most votes and seats in both the 1928 & 1932 Elections. An extremely pragmatic man, Reynaud follows one doctrine in foreign policy; France has no Friends, only Interests."
