bel.1.t:0 "The Belgian Situation"
bel.1.d:0 "Belgium has been a struggling nation for much of the 20th century. With the end of the Guerra Mondiale, Belgium found itself ruled by a German King and going by the name of Flanders-Wallonia, with the royal family in exile and the nation a mere shadow of its former glory. However with the second declaration of independence in 1931, Belgium finally found itself turning the downturn upside down. With the wide coalition of Liberals, Catholics and Socialists, Belgium was finally recovering from economic downfall and years of inefficient rule. But many do threaten the status quo. In the nation many still see Albert as the True king, as opposed to his son, Leopold III. Many rumors also has gone around saying Leopold seeks to take power for himself. Nationalist elements have risen, with the leading figure Leon Degrelle at the helm. However for now, the Belgian situation remains peaceful, with upcoming elections later this year."
