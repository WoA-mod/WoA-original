Whispers of Antiquity
=====================
Whispers of Antiquity was (is?) a mod for Hearts of Iron IV started during early 2016.
The mod originally started as a meme, following the "-reich" trend (in fact, the original name was "Caesarreich", and was meant as spin-off of Fuhrerreich), but it eventually became its own thing, as the mod got more and more original.
It aimed at building an alt-history world following a Great War where Germany won after the USA intervened _on the Central Powers' side_.

You can navigate through the mod's currently available lore starting from the [Master Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Br359d6TpcKUfdYwSO8QbEN4wY_EDeMjtWu969NewK8/edit?usp=sharing "Fraaz's Timesink").

State of the mod
----------------
The mod development eventually slowed drastically down, and the team got reduced to maybe 3-4 developers, who progressively lost motivation.
The Man The Guns update was the final nail in the coffin, as we never found the motivation to finish updating the mod.
After a long period of inactivity, the developers who were still around decided that it would be better to make the mod "open source".
That means, we release what dramatically little we have and "officially" cease work on the mod. We may or may not do things from time to time, who knows.
If you wanna pick up from where we left, browse through this account's repositories for everything we managed to salvage of this mod - from our private history docs to assorted graphics, both discarded and not.

Currently (and don't ask me whose idea was it) the "code" of this thing is an absolute mess full of files we don't need, bugs and CTDs, much of which is connected to the original choice of starting, rather than from scratch, from Fuhrerreich 0.1's code.

Contributing
------------
We've got [a discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/NUCbmhn) to communicate. We're more than happy to accept your pull requests, so long as they follow the lore explained in the Master Doc and they don't break the mod even more. Right now, you might want to focus on fixing the unbelievable amount of bugs and crashes. [This](https://github.com/WoA-mod/WoA/tree/TryinToUpdate) is the branch we are/were working on to make the mod up-to-date.

You can contribute to the lore too, through the Google Docs comment feature. We don't mind anonymous submissions, but obviously in that case you won't be credited.
